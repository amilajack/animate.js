# Animate.js

Add slick sequential animations to your page elements.

### Installation

Setting up <code>animate.js</code> is only a matter of adding a simple script include tag:

    <script src="http://archan937.github.io/animate.js/animate.js"></script>

That's it!

### Configuration

To configure Animate.js, all you have to do is put the configuration in the query string:

  * <code>selector</code> - The CSS selector used for binding the click event to start animating (default: <code>a</code>)

So for example:

    <script src="http://archan937.github.io/animate.js/animate.js?controls&timing=0.5+2+2.25"></script>

Nice, right? :)
